1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,210
This demonstration should take about
five minutes

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,150
and be at a pace that you can follow
along to.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,900
Before we start you should note your
tie has a skinny end and a fat end.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,409
Your first decision is going to be which
side of your body you place the ends.

5
00:00:14,409 --> 00:00:18,069
It doesn't matter which side your tie
goes on, it won't affect the tie tying process

6
00:00:18,069 --> 00:00:22,119
I have posted a mirror image of
this video if that suits you better.

7
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,640
Not only does your tie have two ends,
it has two different sides:

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,300
the face side is smooth,
and the seam side

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,660
is on the back

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,870
We're going to start with the seam side
down so take your tie,

11
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:38,030
and with the seam side down, place it around your neck

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,480
flat against your body, again with the seam
side down.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,910
Here's where we adjust for length. You pull
on the fat end so that the skinny end is

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,720
about at your rib cage. Now choosing length
is a very difficult step, it's a very

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,900
important step, but in this part of the
process we're just trying to tie

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,600
the tie properly, so we're going to skip it.
We will get to it later

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,780
now we're going to take the fat end and
cross it over the skinny end

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,400
move the skinny and over take the fat
end cross it over the skinny end, 

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,460
making an "X".

20
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,980
You'll notice I have one hand
holding the bottom of the "X".

21
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,190
To simplify the process I'm going to
have one hand do all the work while the

22
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,270
other hand just holds
the center of the "X".

23
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,140
The center of the "X" becomes the knot

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,360
so I'm going to call the hand that holds
the "X", the "knot hand". Choose which hand

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,560
you want to be the "knot hand" and take
hold of the center of the "X".

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,930
make sure you have a good grip
and don't let go

27
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,250
but feel free to adjust later if you
need to.

28
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,159
Now the space between the center of the "X"
and your neck

29
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,280
is what i call the tie hole

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,330
it's this area here

31
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,719
now there's four places we can put the tie

32
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,100
we can make the tie come out of the hole

33
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,100
we can make the tie go into the hole

34
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,179
we can make the tie go behind the hole

35
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,510
and we can make the tie go across the hole

36
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,389
the first step we're going to do is take the
tie and make it go out of the hole

37
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:59,910
so take the tie

38
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,070
and make it go out of the hole

39
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,589
i do that by

40
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,910
placing my hand in the front of the tie

41
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,340
and then just push it straight up through the hole

42
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:12,099
with it half way through you can use your
knot hand to hold the bottom of the tie

43
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,518
as you move your working hand around

44
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:20,999
pull the rest of the tie through

45
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:22,099
flipping it over

46
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,329
and let it fall in front of you

47
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:33,329
now we're going to take the tie and make it go
behind the hole

48
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,359
so go ahead and grab the tie

49
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:39,109
pull it over to the side

50
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:42,609
and just push it straight through behind the hole

51
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:46,000
i'm going to place it on my shoulder so
you can see that the seam here

52
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:47,839
is now facing out

53
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:49,638
also take note

54
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,269
that this part here is kind of low

55
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:54,959
now w're going to take the tie

56
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:01,100
and make it go in to the hole

57
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,858
I'm going to grab under

58
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:08,699
flip it around and push it through the
hole

59
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,060
as I'm halfway through I'm going to grab it with my pinky, it's not necessary,

60
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:19,940
 just go ahead and pull the rest of it through

61
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:25,099
again, now flipping it so the seam side
is showing

62
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,510
take a good look at the knot here feel
free to give a small tug on the tie

63
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,099
at the end of every step

64
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,749
you don't want it too tight, but then again not
too loose

65
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:39,138
we're not going to take the tie and go
across the hole

66
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,069
so take the tie, pull it over the side

67
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:43,380
and then make it go across the hole

68
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,150
at this point I have a good tip for you

69
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:53,150
before you go across the hole,
put your finger right here

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,620
again I'm going to place the tie on my
shoulder just so you can see

71
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,299
that the face is now showing

72
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:04,859
the next step is to take the tie and
make it go out of the hole again

73
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:11,400
as we do that we're going to kind of flip it

74
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:13,499
to take the time kind of just

75
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:17,149
push your fingers around and through

76
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,120
again as you make the tie go out of the hole

77
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,210
you're going to flip it over so again
the face is showing. In future it's at this

78
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,430
point you may want to switch hands

79
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,240
but then you won't have the benefit of
the tip i gave earlier

80
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,680
to finish your going to take the fat end
of the tie

81
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,740
and put it behind the across step

82
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,839
it's kind of hard to explain where that
is, which is why i told you to put your

83
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,919
finger there, so take the fat end

84
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,979
and make it go right where your finger is

85
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,680
again i'm using one hand here

86
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,919
but at this point it can be easier to
just grab the fat end with that one

87
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,380
finger either way you're going to pull
the fat end through and keep pulling

88
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,479
until the knot is tight as you're
pulling the knot tight make sure not to

89
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,770
lose the skinny end

90
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:00,639
you can squeeze the bottom to help form
the proper shape

91
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,870
pulling the two tops apart will also help

92
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,580
to tighten the tie around her neck grab
the skinny end with one hand and the

93
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,699
bottom of the knot with the other hand

94
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,589
and now you do a "pull and slide" motion
pull in the skinny end

95
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:15,749
slide the knot, pull, slide

96
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:16,920
tidy up a bit

97
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:22,619
make sure everything looks nice

98
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,079
and now you can flip your collar down

99
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:30,349
it's at this point you should also do up
the top button

100
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:33,069
give it one more tighten

101
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:34,460
and you're all done

102
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,680
now we just need to get the proper
length

103
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,260
and maybe a little faster
