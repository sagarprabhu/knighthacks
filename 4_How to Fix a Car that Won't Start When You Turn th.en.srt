OK.

11
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,169
It's happened to all of us.

12
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,890
You get in your car and turn the
key and the only thing you hear

13
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,280
is a click.

14
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,200
So what do you do?

15
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,849
You open the hood and check.

16
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,439
Up it goes.

17
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,420
Now, if your battery
is weak, the starter

18
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,400
will click because it
doesn't have enough juice

19
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,780
to turn the engine over.

20
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,895
So try jump-starting it first.

21
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:41,410
Get good battery cables.

22
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,569
Cheap ones will melt
or won't work right.

23
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,500
Put the positive on the
positive of your donor battery

24
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,050
and put the other positive
end on the positive

25
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,455
of the battery in your car.

26
00:00:51,455 --> 00:00:54,430
Then put one of the negative
cables on the negative terminal

27
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,560
of your donor battery.

28
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,320
Clamp the other negative
one on any solid metal

29
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,060
part on the engine.

30
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,310
That keeps the battery from
accidentally blowing up

31
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,050
from hydrogen vapor.

32
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,130
Now, we'll turn it.

33
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,490
And nope, the car
still won't start.

34
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,199
So I know the battery is good.

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,160
It's not the battery.

36
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,590
Now, generally, either
the starter's bad

37
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,120
or the engine is locked up.

38
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,920
So let's try turning
the engine by hand

39
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,570
to see if it's locked up.

40
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,830
We'll take the wheel
out of the way.

41
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,179
And there's the current
shaft fold right here.

42
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,132
You will get a cheater bar and
a socket that fits on there.

43
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:29,590
We'll put it on the bolt and
see if we can turn the engine.

44
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,170
Now, it turns so we know
the engine isn't locked up.

45
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,600
That leaves the number one
culprit being a bad starter.

46
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,815
So let's take the
starter off and test it.

47
00:01:36,816 --> 00:01:38,440
Now, in this car,
the starter is easier

48
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,870
to access from the bottom,
so you jack it up in the air

49
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,900
and there's the starter
motor right there.

50
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,330
We can test it by
hot-wiring it first to see

51
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,260
if it'll work if we do that.

52
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,750
Now, in this starter motor,
this little wire here

53
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,790
is the one that energizes it,
so we'll put a jumper wire

54
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,620
on top of that little wire.

55
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,865
Touch it on the positive
terminal of the battery.

56
00:01:59,865 --> 00:02:01,990
Well, it's a good thing we
did that because there's

57
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,369
nothing wrong with the starter.

58
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,270
There's a problem in the wiring
system that we have to fix.

59
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,380
Now, starting systems
have relays and switches

60
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,713
and all kinds of things in them.

61
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,370
But I noticed the backup
lights are on in this car.

62
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,120
Now the backup lights
stay on in this car,

63
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,577
whether it's in park, neutral,
drive-- it doesn't matter.

64
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:18,910
So there's got to be a problem
in the transmission range

65
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,410
sensors.

66
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,710
It's probably broken.

67
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,010
So I called up a Chevy
dealer and they're $163.

68
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,350
And considering the
shape of this old car

69
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,609
with a taped-on mirror
that just fell off

70
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,820
and body parts that are
barely even hanging on,

71
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,579
I'm just going to bypass it.

72
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,230
Splice the two wires together
to bypass the switch so

73
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,182
that it'll start all the time.

74
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:40,140
The owner doesn't care.

75
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,055
He just wants the car
to start and as long

76
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:43,680
as he remembers if
it's in drive and he

77
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,360
hits the start and
the car will start,

78
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,887
it's not going to hurt anything.

79
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:48,470
You just go down to
the neutral safety

80
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,660
switch here and pull
the connector off.

81
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,859
Here's the connector.

82
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,000
Then with the test
light, see which one gets

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,460
power when you turn the key on.

84
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,880
And in this case,
it's this wire.

85
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,799
Then find the wire that
when it gets power,

86
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,600
turns the starter on like this.

87
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,480
You get power with
your device and then

88
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,450
the engine starts right up.

89
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,640
Then you just splice those two
wires together and it'll start.

90
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,332
Now, granted, it'll
start in all gears now.

91
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:17,790
But it saved a
whole bunch of money

92
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,160
and this old thing, who
knows how much longer it's

93
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,320
going to be on the road anyway.

94
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,579
So the next time your
car doesn't do anything

95
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,430
when you turn the key
and try to start it,

96
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,652
why not fix it yourself.

97
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:30,892
