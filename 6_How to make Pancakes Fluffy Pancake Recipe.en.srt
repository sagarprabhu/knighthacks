00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,410
This recipe makes the softest fluffiest pancakes
and most if not all of the ingredients you

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,120
should be able to find in your kitchen.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:24,220
Pour yourself a cup of coffee and whip these
up for brunch this weekend.

4
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:31,288
Start by measuring out a cup and half of all
purpose flour into a large mixing bowl.

5
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,520
This recipe makes enough for 3-4 people so
if you are cooking for more just double the

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,070
recipe.

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,140
You can find a printable version on my website,
or check the information box below for the

8
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,590
measurements.

9
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:54,710
In the same bowl as the flour measure out
4 teaspoons of baking powder.

10
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,760
4 may seem like a lot, but this is the secret
to getting the softest, fluffiest pancakes.

11
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,759
As the pancakes cook the baking powder is
going to react and create an abundance of

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:15,460
air, getting that perfect pancake texture.

13
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,259
Lastly to the dry ingredients add a pinch
of salt.

14
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,250
You can add sugar here as well if you would
like, around a tablespoon, but I prefer to

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,500
add sweetness with toppings rather than with
the actual pancake.

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,930
Use a wooden spoon to mix the dry ingredients
together until they are combined.

17
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,040
Set the bowl to the side.

18
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,940
In a smaller bowl to mix together the wet
ingredients.

19
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,170
First crack in on large free range egg, followed
by the milk.

20
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:58,130
I’m using dairy but you can substitute with
soy or almond if you would like.

21
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,500
To the egg and milk add in a 1/4 cup of cooled
melted butter.

22
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:20,020
Use a fork to mix everything together, making
sure the egg is well incorporated.

23
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,700
This is optional, but I love a hint of vanilla.

24
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:41,089
Add half a teaspoon of pure vanilla essence
and mix again.

25
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,770
Make a well in flour and pour in the wet ingredients.

26
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:50,140
Fold the batter together with a wooden spoon
until there are no longer any large lumps..

27
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,549
Make sure you’re not over mixing as this
will lead to your pancakes being quite tough.

28
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:02,050
I’ve kept these pancakes quite pain but
if you do want to add blueberries or chocolate

29
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:12,310
chips, or any other flavourings now would
be a good time.

30
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,760
When you are ready to cook the pancakes heat
a heavy bottomed pan like cast iron over medium

31
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,220
low heat.

32
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,750
When the pan has heated add a small amount
of butter to the pan to melt.

33
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,819
Scoop out about a 1/3 of a cup of batter and
pour into the pan.

34
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:33,230
Leave the pancake to spread on it’s own
and cook for a few minutes.

35
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:42,079
You’ll know it’s ready to flip when air
bubbles start to form on the top.

36
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,459
If you are unsure just use a spatula to lift
up the side and check the bottom.

37
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:53,860
Flip and cook for a further few minutes on
the opposite side.

38
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,680
If your pancakes are browning a little to
quickly just adjust the heat.

39
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:09,980
Place the cooked pancake on a plate and repeat
with the next.

40
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,959
You should get about 6 or 7 pancakes out of
this recipe so continue until you are out

41
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:23,060
of batter.

42
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,190
Top the pancakes with maple syrup and any
of your other favourite toppings.

43
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,969
Send me a photo if you try out this recipe,
I would love to see your favourite pancake

44
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,970
topping.

45
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,480
Thank you for watching, I hope you enjoyed
this recipe and I will see you in my next

46
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
video.

47
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:38,481
Bye.
