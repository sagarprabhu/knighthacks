00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,720
Hello, in this HealthSketch, we want to talk
to you about CPR,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,760
which stands for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,129
We use CPR when someone has collapsed and
is not breathing, because it can keep people

4
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:18,470
alive until emergency services arrive.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:24,710
Learning these simple life-saving skills is
as easy as ABC - all you have to remember

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,599
is the “Doctor’s ABC”.

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,060
D is for Danger: First, look around carefully
to make sure the area is safe for yourself

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,670
and others before approaching.

9
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:43,440
R is for Response: Shake them gently by the
shoulders and ask them loudly “Are you alright?”

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,199
If there is no response, you need to...

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,070
S: Shout for help, as any assistance will
be helpful

12
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:57,480
A is for Airway: Gently tilt the head back
like this, to open up the airway.

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:06,140
B is for Breathing: Look, Listen and Feel
for signs of normal breathing: LOOK for normal

14
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,640
chest movements, LISTEN for normal breathing
sounds and try to FEEL their breath against

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,900
your face.

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,470
Do this for no more than 10 seconds.

17
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,391
If there is no sign of breathing, or if they
are breathing in an unusual, noisy way, we

18
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:23,350
need to start CPR.

19
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,580
First, make sure that an ambulance is on its
way.

20
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,710
If you have someone else with you, ask them
to make the call.

21
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,030
Putting the phone on speaker mode is useful
as the ambulance service can talk you through

22
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,660
the steps.

23
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:43,300
C is for Circulation: Circulation means the
flow of blood around the body, and when the

24
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,140
heart stops pumping, we need to take over
this role by pushing down hard and fast on

25
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,470
the chest.

26
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,640
Start by placing the heel of one hand at the
centre of the person’s chest and interlock

27
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,310
your fingers like this.

28
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:03,030
With arms straightened, press down hard and
fast, letting the chest come back up fully

29
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,210
each time.

30
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,750
Fast means around 2 times every second (metronome
sound) and hard means that the chest needs

31
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,610
to go down by about 5 centimetres.

32
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,430
This might sound a lot but you do need to
push hard for it to be effective.

33
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,659
If you have been trained, you can give 2 ‘rescue
breaths’ after every 30 compressions, as

34
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:25,650
this helps provide some oxygen.

35
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,849
However, if you have not been trained or are
not comfortable, just keep going with ‘Hands-only’

36
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:33,079
continuous chest compressions.

37
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,540
If someone else is with you, swap over if
you begin to feel tired, and don’t stop

38
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,719
until either a health professional takes over,
or the person is definitely breathing normally.

39
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,230
Sometimes, we can add another step – ‘D’.

40
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,999
D is for Defibrillation, which is about delivering
a shock to restart the heartbeat.

41
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:57,489
Some public areas and workplaces have an easy-to-use
defibrillator on site, called an Automatic

42
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:01,069
External Defibrillator, or AED.

43
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:06,349
Automatic means that it is the machine that
decides what to do, so you can’t go wrong,

44
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:08,619
and it even talks you through the steps.

45
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,529
If there is no AED available, keep going with
CPR until the ambulance arrives.

46
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:14,829
That’s it!

47
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:25,370
So to recap: remember DR’S ABC and if you
have it, D. That’s D for Danger, R for response.

48
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:36,129
S for shout for help, A for Airway, B for
Breathing, C for Circulation and D for Defibrillation.

49
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:40,179
In this HealthSketch, we’ve shown you the
simple steps you can take to help someone

50
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,120
who has collapsed, is not breathing, or not
breathing normally.

51
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,980
Why not take a training course to practice
these steps.

52
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,220
Share this video with friends and family to
make sure we all know what to do.
