1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,290
- Hey everyone, my name
is Jacques Hopkins,

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,530
and thank you so much for
joining me here today,

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,730
where we're going to learn some piano.

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,055
In this lesson, I'm going to take you

5
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:12,420
from the very, very beginning
of the piano learning process,

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,340
all the way to, at the end of this lesson,

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,620
you're going to be able to
play a song on the piano.

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,230
And not just any song, it's
not gonna be Three Blind Mice

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,330
or something like that.

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,169
We're gonna play a
very, very popular song.

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,427
We're gonna play "Let It Be",

12
00:00:25,427 --> 00:00:28,450
by the one and only, The Beatles.

13
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,830
In just about 15 minutes
or so, in this lesson.

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,930
I will take you from,

15
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,320
even if you've never
touched a piano before,

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,870
to being able to play "Let
It Be", by The Beatles.

17
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,890
So let's go ahead and get started.

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,180
Now, this is my keyboard, it has 88 keys.

19
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,840
That is a standard amount
of keys for any piano.

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,610
If you have a keyboard,
that has less than 88 keys,

21
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,050
chances are that's okay.

22
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,730
I want you to have at least 49 keys.

23
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,331
So if you have at least 49 keys,

24
00:00:56,332 --> 00:00:58,170
then you're ready to get started.

25
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,670
If you don't have 49 keys,
if you have less than that,

26
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,370
you can give this a shot,

27
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,835
but keep in mind that I did warn you,

28
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:07,650
you may not have enough
room for both of your hands.

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,340
Now, if you're not
familiar with the piano,

30
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,770
if you don't know how to play it,

31
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,580
just looking at one could be intimidating.

32
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,340
Alright, so we have 88 keys here.

33
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,730
There's these black keys,
there's these white keys.

34
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,730
You know, what's the
difference between the two?

35
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,720
And that's the first step,

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,263
is we're gonna learn what
all the notes are called

37
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:26,460
on the piano, so you can play all them,

38
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,649
each individual note.

39
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,525
Alright, so, you don't have to memorize

40
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:32,217
all 88 keys on the piano.

41
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,475
You just have to memorize these sections

42
00:01:34,475 --> 00:01:37,770
of 12 keys, because those
patterns, those sections,

43
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,194
they just repeat themselves
over and over again,

44
00:01:40,194 --> 00:01:42,240
across the entire piano.

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,759
So let's zoom in on one of
these sections of 12 keys.

46
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,870
You'll notice there are seven white keys,

47
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,310
and there are five black keys.

48
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,150
You see these two black
keys that are together,

49
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,450
and then we have these three
black keys are together.

50
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,520
Look at that pattern, that
pattern just repeats itself

51
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,660
across the entire piano.

52
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,950
So, there's not really 88
different notes on the piano.

53
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,970
There's really 12 different notes.

54
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,910
So we need to learn these 12 notes,

55
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,410
and once you've learned those 12 notes,

56
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,199
you've learned all 88 of them.

57
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,679
So, let's dive right in.

58
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,740
The most popular note,

59
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,150
you probably have heard it before, it's C.

60
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,136
Alright, right here is
C, it's the white note

61
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,010
just to the left of the
any two black notes.

62
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,100
So this is C, this is
C, this is C and so on.

63
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,030
But we're just gonna focus in
on this section right here.

64
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,960
So, in music, we go to the right,

65
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,240
we go continue down the alphabet.

66
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,430
So we go C, D, E,

67
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,430
F, G, and then in music,

68
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,817
not just piano, but in music,

69
00:02:38,817 --> 00:02:41,180
the letters start over after G.

70
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,120
So after G is not H,
there's no H in music.

71
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,310
This is A, and then B.

72
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,310
So again, C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,880
So there's the seven white notes.

74
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,280
And then we have the five black notes.

75
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,090
So these black notes are
named for their relationship

76
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,230
with the white note next to them, okay.

77
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,617
So, for example, right here,

78
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:10,617
this is called C sharp,
and it's also D flat.

79
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,788
So every black note does
have two names, okay.

80
00:03:13,788 --> 00:03:16,871
But the way you remember
which one is which,

81
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:19,750
like which way is sharp,
which way is flat,

82
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,160
is like this.

83
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,720
Sharp, the word sharp has five
letters in the word, right?

84
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,500
So does the word right.

85
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,700
So sharp and right always go together.

86
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,690
Flat and left both have
four letters in the word,

87
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,716
so a flat is always to the left

88
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:37,440
of the corresponding white note.

89
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,990
So that's why this is D
flat, and also C sharp.

90
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,330
So let's keep going down

91
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,240
and learn the other five black notes.

92
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,240
This is D sharp, and it's also E flat.

93
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,040
Alright, so what's this one right here?

94
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,225
We have F sharp, and it's also G flat.

95
00:03:56,225 --> 00:04:00,492
This one is G sharp, and it's also A flat.

96
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:03,355
And finally we have
this one, it's A sharp,

97
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:05,890
it's also B flat.

98
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,565
Okay, so there's 12 notes.

99
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:09,780
One of the first steps to
learning how to play piano

100
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,400
is just learning those keys.

101
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,920
And the best way to do that
is just with some flashcards,

102
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,332
or you can just get somebody,
a friend or family member,

103
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:18,995
to randomly call one out for you,

104
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:21,570
and you need to go,
and you need to play it

105
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,580
as quickly as you possibly can.

106
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,630
And you just drill that
until these 12 notes

107
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,960
become second nature for you.

108
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,592
Now, what I don't wanna
see from you at this point

109
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:33,962
is you learn C, you figure out where C is,

110
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:36,700
and you just think you
know all the other keys,

111
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
just because you know C.

112
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,710
So if I say play me a G key,

113
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,239
I don't want you going
okay, here's C, D, E, F, G.

114
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,570
Okay I got it.

115
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,659
No, I want, I want to say G,
and you go boom, right to G.

116
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,273
I like to think of it
like the days of the week.

117
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:52,463
If I ask you to tell me about Wednesday,

118
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:55,481
you're not gonna start
counting at Sunday or Monday,

119
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:58,409
and count, okay, Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

120
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,968
okay it's the fourth day of the week.

121
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:02,320
No, you're not gonna do that,
that would just be silly.

122
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,920
You already know, it's
second nature for you,

123
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,515
you know that Wednesday's
the middle weekday,

124
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:11,130
it comes after Tuesday,
it comes before Thursday.

125
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,212
Had to think about it for a second.

126
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,700
So, I want you to get to a point

127
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,080
with these notes on the piano.

128
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,800
There's no reason you can't
know the notes on the piano,

129
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,350
just as well as you know
the days of the week.

130
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,100
So before you move too
far ahead with the piano,

131
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,212
you're going to set yourself up

132
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:26,930
with such a great foundation,

133
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,344
if you truly learn just these 12 notes.

134
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:33,099
Okay, so once you do
that, the next step is,

135
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,550
we're gonna start playing
chords on the piano.

136
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,857
What a chord is is simply multiple notes

137
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:39,670
played at the same time.

138
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,770
Whereas, we were just
playing single notes,

139
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,123
this is a C note, this is not a chord.

140
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,856
This right here would be a chord,

141
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:49,210
because it's multiple notes
played at the same time.

142
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,212
And chords, when you put chords together,

143
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:55,720
that's actually how we build
modern songs on the piano.

144
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,290
And the majority of songs use chords

145
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,592
that fall into one of two categories.

146
00:06:01,592 --> 00:06:05,340
We have the major chords, and
the we have the minor chords.

147
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,530
Okay, so the major chords are the ones,

148
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,520
they sound a little
more happy and cheerful.

149
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,988
Kind of like this, this is a major chord.

150
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:12,920
(strikes major chord on keyboard)

151
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,470
And then the minor chords,

152
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,980
they're a little more sad and dreary.

153
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,978
So this is an example of a minor chord.

154
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,350
(strikes minor chord on keyboard)

155
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,610
So can you hear the difference there?

156
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,665
Major chord.

157
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:22,630
(strikes major chord on keyboard)

158
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,512
Minor chord.

159
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:26,000
(strikes minor chord on keyboard)

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,270
And most modern songs will have a good mix

161
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,950
of major chords and minor chords.

162
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,190
Now, there's a lot of them,

163
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,170
but you don't have to
memorize each and every one.

164
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,870
That's the beauty of patterns and formulas

165
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,020
and piano, it's really
not a hard instrument.

166
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,546
So I'm gonna share with
you a very simple formula

167
00:06:43,547 --> 00:06:46,930
for major chords, and once
you know this formula,

168
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,060
you know all the major chords.

169
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,780
And I'll share with you the
formula for minor chords,

170
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,320
and once you learn that formula,

171
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,580
you know all the minor chords.

172
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,849
It's a very simple formula.

173
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,130
So for major chords, that
formula is simply four, three.

174
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,060
Here's how you use that.

175
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,320
Let's say we wanna play a G major chord.

176
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,912
Okay, so we'll start at G,

177
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:07,310
we'll go to the right,
the very next four notes,

178
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,890
and it doesn't matter black or white,

179
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,229
whatever's next, count it.

180
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,240
So one, two, three, four.

181
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,420
There's four, and then we'll go three.

182
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,543
One, two, three.

183
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:19,530
There's a G major chord.

184
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,909
Go ahead and play with your thumb,

185
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,796
your middle finger, and
your pinky finger for now.

186
00:07:23,796 --> 00:07:24,629
G major.

187
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:26,400
Let's try one more major chord.

188
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,750
Let's do a D major chord.

189
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,280
So we'll start at D.

190
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,198
One, two, three, four.

191
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,945
One, two, three.

192
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:34,304
D major.

193
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:36,751
Even if you ran into
something super complicated

194
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:40,670
like a B flat major chord,
don't get overwhelmed.

195
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,540
Just use the formula.

196
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,020
It's still just four, three.

197
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,210
B flat, left because it's flat.

198
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,390
One, two, three, four.

199
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,159
One, two, three.

200
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,670
B flat major chord.

201
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,879
Alright, let's do minor chords.

202
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,568
The formula for minor
chords is very, very similar

203
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:58,409
to the formula for major chords,

204
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,243
you just to reverse it.

205
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:00,510
So it's three and then four.

206
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,170
So let's say we wanted to play E minor.

207
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,760
We start at E, we go one, two, three.

208
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,890
And then one, two, three, four.

209
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,719
E minor.

210
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,925
Let's try C minor.

211
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,419
C, one, two, three.

212
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:15,407
One, two, three, four.

213
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:16,289
Okay.

214
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,580
So one thing I wanna point out here

215
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,669
is the difference between
a major and a minor chord.

216
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,630
If you look at the notes you play,

217
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,469
it's actually only one note difference,

218
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,618
and that's because four
plus three is seven

219
00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:29,780
and also three plus four is seven.

220
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,631
So let's take the C chord as an example.

221
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:35,419
Here we have a C major chord.

222
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,699
The only difference between
a major and a minor chord

223
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,705
is the middle note.

224
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:41,999
(striking minor and
major chords alternately)

225
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:42,970
There we go.

226
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,160
So you're going to want
to practice your chords.

227
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,959
Practice your major chords,
practice your minor chords,

228
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,203
and then we can start playing

229
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:53,663
our favorite songs on the piano
because they're just built

230
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:56,730
with mostly major and minor chords.

231
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,873
Now that we've got the major
and minor chords nailed down,

232
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:00,520
I want you to go ahead

233
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,040
and let's learn how to
play the left hand as well.

234
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,040
And at this point, I want to
see if your hand is big enough

235
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,390
to do what I'd like you to do,

236
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,340
and if not, I've got a
different method for you.

237
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,180
But what we're going to
do is we're going to play

238
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,770
a C major chord.

239
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,829
In our left hand, I just
want you to play two C's,

240
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,071
one with your pinky and
one with your thumb.

241
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:20,130
(strikes C major chord on keyboard)

242
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,307
So like that, that's how we're
going to play a C major chord

243
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:24,870
and the left hand is the same
whether it's major or minor.

244
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,470
So a C minor would be like this.

245
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,960
If you cannot reach
your fingers like that,

246
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,000
if you have small hands

247
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,847
and that's just not comfortable for you,

248
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:36,210
what I want you to do is just
play one note instead of two,

249
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,127
so like this:

250
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:37,959
(strikes major chord)

251
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,888
or like this:

252
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:39,721
(strikes minor chord)

253
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:40,554
No problem.

254
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:42,261
Alright, so now that we
know how to play both hands,

255
00:09:42,261 --> 00:09:45,579
major and minor chords, let's
go ahead and work on the song

256
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,950
that I told you about,
"Let it Be" by The Beatles.

257
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,820
The way this goes is we're going to start

258
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,453
with a C major chord
and you play it twice.

259
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:55,380
(strikes chord twice on keyboard)

260
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,194
And then it goes to G
major, play that twice.

261
00:09:58,194 --> 00:09:59,209
(strikes chord twice on keyboard)

262
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,985
And then we have A minor.

263
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:03,040
(strikes chord twice on keyboard)

264
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,031
And then we have F major.

265
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:06,770
(strikes chord twice on keyboard)

266
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,640
Okay?

267
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,380
And then we go back to C major.

268
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,200
(strikes chord twice on keyboard)

269
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,059
And then G major.

270
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:13,500
(strikes chord twice on keyboard)

271
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,730
So everything so far,

272
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,010
all the chords I mentioned so far,

273
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,305
there's been six of
them, we play them twice.

274
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:22,560
Now there's four more chords
and you just play them once

275
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,459
and one of them is a little tricky.

276
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,930
It's gonna be the trickiest
part of this whole song,

277
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,420
but I'm gonna hold your
hand right through it.

278
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,285
So we have four more chords,

279
00:10:30,285 --> 00:10:32,760
and you're just going
to play them one time.

280
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,110
So we have F major.

281
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,080
Alright, this next one is the tricky one.

282
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,590
We're going to do what's called a C/E,

283
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,180
and what that means is
we're going to do a C

284
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,145
on our right hand while
doing an E in our left hand.

285
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:47,250
Okay, and then the last
two are pretty standard,

286
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,577
we go to a D minor and then a C major.

287
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:52,640
Right, so let me hit
those last four again.

288
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,640
It's F, then it's C/E, D minor, C.

289
00:10:57,674 --> 00:10:59,890
Alright, so let's run through
that whole sequence again.

290
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,537
Remember the first six chords we do,

291
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,552
you play them twice
and then the last four,

292
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:05,393
you just play them once.

293
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:09,226
(striking chords on keyboard)

294
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,197
You see how that's starting to sound like

295
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:20,806
"Let it Be" by The Beatles?

296
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:23,700
Let me do it for you just one more time

297
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,470
and then go ahead and practice
these chords on your own.

298
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,450
It's 10 chords in all.

299
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,284
Remember the first six,
we're gonna play them twice,

300
00:11:30,284 --> 00:11:33,465
and the last four, we're
going to do it once.

301
00:11:33,465 --> 00:11:37,298
(striking chords on keyboard)

302
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,490
So now you'll hopefully be able to impress

303
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,650
all your friends and family

304
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,770
by being able to play "Let
It Be" by The Beatles,

305
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,770
at least a basic version of that song.

306
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,500
